### Introduction
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.
This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.
### Data
The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the course web site:
* [Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) [47Mb]
There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.
* National Weather Service [Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)
* National Climatic Data Center Storm Events [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)
The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.
### Assignment
The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. You must use the database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire analysis. Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.
#### Questions
Your data analysis must address the following questions:
1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the `EVTYPE` variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
Consider writing your report as if it were to be read by a government or municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events. However, there is no need to make any specific recommendations in your report.
#### Requirements
For this assignment you will need some specific tools
* RStudio: You will need RStudio to publish your completed analysis document to RPubs. You can also use RStudio to edit/write your analysis.
* knitr: You will need the knitr package in order to compile your R Markdown document and convert it to HTML
#### Document Layout
* Language: Your document should be written in English.
* Title: Your document should have a title that <b>briefly</b> summarizes your data analysis
* Synopsis: Immediately after the title, there should be a <b>synopsis</b> which describes and summarizes your analysis in at <b>most 10 complete sentences</b>.
* There should be a section titled <b>Data Processing</b> which describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis <i>must</i> start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the `cache = TRUE` option for certain code chunks.
* There should be a section titled <b>Results</b> in which your results are presented.
* You may have other sections in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are <b>required</b>.
* The analysis document must have <b>at least one figure containing a plot</b>.
* Your analyis must have <b>no more than three figures</b>. Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.
* You must show all your code for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. In general, you should ensure that `echo = TRUE` for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).
#### Publishing Your Analysis
For this assignment you will need to publish your analysis on [RPubs.com](http://rpubs.com/). If you do not already have an account, then you will have to create a new account. After you have completed writing your analysis in RStudio, you can publish it to RPubs by doing the following:
1. In RStudio, make sure your R Markdown document (`.Rmd`) document is loaded in the editor
2. Click the `Knit HTML` button in the doc toolbar to preview your document.
3. In the preview window, click the `Publish` button.
Once your document is published to RPubs, you should get a unique URL to that document. <b>Make a note of this URL</b> as you will need it to submit your assignment.
<b>NOTE</b>: If you are having trouble connecting with RPubs due to proxy-related or other issues, you can upload your final analysis document file as a PDF to Coursera instead.
#### Submitting Your Assignment
In order to submit this assignment, you must copy the RPubs URL for your completed data analysis document in to the peer assessment question.

## Impact of Severe Weather Events on Public Health and Economy in the United States

### Synonpsis  
In this report, we aim to analyze the impact of different weather events on public health and economy based on the storm database collected from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) from 1950 - 2011. We will use the estimates of fatalities, injuries, property and crop damage to decide which types of event are most harmful to the population health and economy. From these data, we found that excessive heat and tornado are most harmful with respect to population health, while flood, drought, and hurricane/typhoon have the greatest economic consequences.

### Basic settings
```{r}
echo = TRUE  # Always make code visible
options(scipen = 1)  # Turn off scientific notations for numbers
library(R.utils)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
require(gridExtra)
```

### Data Processing
First, we download the data file and unzip it.
```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/Online Coursera/Coursera-Reproducible-Research/RepData_PeerAssessment2/")
if (!"stormData.csv.bz2" %in% dir("./data/")) {
    print("hhhh")
    download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", destfile = "data/stormData.csv.bz2")
    bunzip2("data/stormData.csv.bz2", overwrite=T, remove=F)
}
```
Then, we read the generated csv file. If the data already exists in the working environment, we do not need to load it again. Otherwise, we read the csv file.
```{r}
if (!"stormData" %in% ls()) {
    stormData <- read.csv("data/stormData.csv", sep = ",")
}
dim(stormData)
head(stormData, n = 2)
```
There are 902297 rows and 37 columns in total.
The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

```{r}
if (dim(stormData)[2] == 37) {
    stormData$year <- as.numeric(format(as.Date(stormData$BGN_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"), "%Y"))
}
hist(stormData$year, breaks = 30)
```  

Based on the above histogram, we see that the number of events tracked starts to significantly increase around 1995. So, we use the subset of the data from 1990 to 2011 to get most out of good records.
```{r}
storm <- stormData[stormData$year >= 1995, ]
dim(storm)
```
Now, there are 681500 rows and 38 columns in total.

#### Impact on Public Health
In this section, we check the number of **fatalities** and **injuries** that are caused by the severe weather events. We would like to get the first 15 most severe types of weather events.
```{r}
sortHelper <- function(fieldName, top = 15, dataset = stormData) {
    index <- which(colnames(dataset) == fieldName)
    field <- aggregate(dataset[, index], by = list(dataset$EVTYPE), FUN = "sum")
    names(field) <- c("EVTYPE", fieldName)
    field <- arrange(field, field[, 2], decreasing = T)
    field <- head(field, n = top)
    field <- within(field, EVTYPE <- factor(x = EVTYPE, levels = field$EVTYPE))
    return(field)
}
fatalities <- sortHelper("FATALITIES", dataset = storm)
injuries <- sortHelper("INJURIES", dataset = storm)
```

#### Impact on Economy
We will convert the **property damage** and **crop damage** data into comparable numerical forms according to the meaning of units described in the code book ([Storm Events](http://ire.org/nicar/database-library/databases/storm-events/)). Both `PROPDMGEXP` and `CROPDMGEXP` columns record a multiplier for each observation where we have Hundred (H), Thousand (K), Million (M) and Billion (B).

```{r}
convertHelper <- function(dataset = storm, fieldName, newFieldName) {
    totalLen <- dim(dataset)[2]
    index <- which(colnames(dataset) == fieldName)
    dataset[, index] <- as.character(dataset[, index])
    logic <- !is.na(toupper(dataset[, index]))
    dataset[logic & toupper(dataset[, index]) == "B", index] <- "9"
    dataset[logic & toupper(dataset[, index]) == "M", index] <- "6"
    dataset[logic & toupper(dataset[, index]) == "K", index] <- "3"
    dataset[logic & toupper(dataset[, index]) == "H", index] <- "2"
    dataset[logic & toupper(dataset[, index]) == "", index] <- "0"
    dataset[, index] <- as.numeric(dataset[, index])
    dataset[is.na(dataset[, index]), index] <- 0
    dataset <- cbind(dataset, dataset[, index - 1] * 10^dataset[, index])
    names(dataset)[totalLen + 1] <- newFieldName
    return(dataset)
}
storm <- convertHelper(storm, "PROPDMGEXP", "propertyDamage")
storm <- convertHelper(storm, "CROPDMGEXP", "cropDamage")
names(storm)
options(scipen=999)
property <- sortHelper("propertyDamage", dataset = storm)
crop <- sortHelper("cropDamage", dataset = storm)
```

### Results
As for the impact on public health, we have got two sorted lists of severe weather events below by the number of people badly affected.
```{r}
fatalities
injuries
```
And the following is a pair of graphs of total fatalities and total injuries affected by these severe weather events. 
```{r}
fatalitiesPlot <- qplot(EVTYPE, data = fatalities, weight = FATALITIES, geom = "bar", binwidth = 1) + 
    scale_y_continuous("Number of Fatalities") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, 
    hjust = 1)) + xlab("Severe Weather Type") + 
    ggtitle("Total Fatalities by Severe Weather\n Events in the U.S.\n from 1995 - 2011")
injuriesPlot <- qplot(EVTYPE, data = injuries, weight = INJURIES, geom = "bar", binwidth = 1) + 
    scale_y_continuous("Number of Injuries") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, 
    hjust = 1)) + xlab("Severe Weather Type") + 
    ggtitle("Total Injuries by Severe Weather\n Events in the U.S.\n from 1995 - 2011")
grid.arrange(fatalitiesPlot, injuriesPlot, ncol = 2)
```  

Based on the above histograms, we find that **excessive heat** and **tornado** cause most fatalities; **tornato** causes most injuries in the United States from 1995 to 2011.

As for the impact on economy, we have got two sorted lists below by the amount of money cost by damages.  

```{r}
property
crop
```
And the following is a pair of graphs of total property damage and total crop damage affected by these severe weather events. 
```{r}
propertyPlot <- qplot(EVTYPE, data = property, weight = propertyDamage, geom = "bar", binwidth = 1) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + scale_y_continuous("Property Damage in US dollars")+ 
    xlab("Severe Weather Type") + ggtitle("Total Property Damage by\n Severe Weather Events in\n the U.S. from 1995 - 2011")
cropPlot<- qplot(EVTYPE, data = crop, weight = cropDamage, geom = "bar", binwidth = 1) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + scale_y_continuous("Crop Damage in US dollars") + 
    xlab("Severe Weather Type") + ggtitle("Total Crop Damage by \nSevere Weather Events in\n the U.S. from 1995 - 2011")
grid.arrange(propertyPlot, cropPlot, ncol = 2)
```  

Based on the above histograms, we find that **flood** and **hurricane/typhoon** cause most property damage; **drought** and **flood** causes most crop damage in the United States from 1995 to 2011.

### Conclusion  
From these data, we found that **excessive heat** and **tornado** are most harmful with respect to population health, while **flood**, **drought**, and **hurricane/typhoon** have the greatest economic consequences.

    hjust = 1)) + xlab("Severe Weather Type") + 
    ggtitle("Total Fatalities by Severe Weather\n Events in the U.S.\n from 1995 - 2011")

    scale_y_continuous("Number of Injuries") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,

    ggtitle("Total Injuries by Severe Weather\n Events in the U.S.\n from 1995 - 2011")
grid.arrange(fatalitiesPlot, injuriesPlot, ncol = 2)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9](figure/unnamed-chunk-9.png) 

Based on the above histograms, we find that **excessive heat** and **tornado** cause most fatalities; **tornato** causes most injuries in the United States from 1995 to 2011.

As for the impact on economy, we have got two sorted lists below by the amount of money cost by damages.

And the following is a pair of graphs of total property damage and total crop damage affected by these severe weather events. 

```r
propertyPlot <- qplot(EVTYPE, data = property, weight = propertyDamage, geom = "bar", binwidth = 1) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + scale_y_continuous("Property Damage in US dollars")+ 
    xlab("Severe Weather Type") + ggtitle("Total Property Damage by\n Severe Weather Events in\n the U.S. from 1995 - 2011")
cropPlot<- qplot(EVTYPE, data = crop, weight = cropDamage, geom = "bar", binwidth = 1) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + scale_y_continuous("Crop Damage in US dollars") + 
    xlab("Severe Weather Type") + ggtitle("Total Crop Damage by \nSevere Weather Events in\n the U.S. from 1995 - 2011")
grid.arrange(propertyPlot, cropPlot, ncol = 2)
```

Based on the above histograms, we find that **flood** and **hurricane/typhoon** cause most property damage; **drought** and **flood** causes most crop damage in the United States from 1995 to 2011.

### Conclusion  
From these data, we found that **excessive heat** and **tornado** are most harmful with respect to population health, while **flood**, **drought**, and **hurricane/typhoon** have the greatest economic consequences.
